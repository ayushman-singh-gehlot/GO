The type of the receiver parameter is the type that the method becomes associated with. But aside
from that, the receiver parameter doesnâ€™t get special treatment from Go. You can access its contents
within the method block just like you would any other function parameter.
As with any other function, you can define additional parameters within parentheses following the
method name
